    "1. INTRODUCTION\n",
    "The near-Earth space environment is of strategic importance in commercial, scientific and\n",
    "security endeavors. Space is a dynamic environment in which space-weather events can affect\n",
    "communication, remote sensing, global positioning satellites (GPS), as well as large ground\n",
    "infrastructure such as pipelines and power grids. For those reasons considerable efforts are made\n",
    "to monitor and characterize this harsh and variable environment in order to better understand\n",
    "its behavior and mitigate possible adverse effects. Monitoring and characterizing these conditions\n",
    "relies upon the acquisition of plasma parameters such as the electron and ion densities and\n",
    "temperatures. Because of its relative simplicity, the Langmuir probe is a common instrument\n",
    "used to make such measurements. Langmuir probes are electrodes biased to various voltages with\n",
    "respect to the satellite ground, from which characteristics, that is, current as a function of bias\n",
    "voltage, are measured. These characteristics then constitute low level (L1B in space instrument\n",
    "terminology) data that must then be interpreted in terms of physical parameters (level L2) such as\n",
    "the plasma density, temperature, or spacecraft floating potential. The physics of current collection\n",
    "by Langmuir probes has been studied by many authors over the course of nearly one century [1–7],\n",
    "and the resulting analytic approximations form the basis of probe characteristic interpretation in\n",
    "most laboratory and space experiments. The use of analytic expressions to infer plasma parameters\n",
    "from characteristics is dictated by the need for fast algorithms capable of providing answers in\n",
    "real time. Unfortunately, analytic approximations cannot account for a combination of the many\n",
    "physical processes at play in the lab or in space, such as the effect of a magnetic field, plasma drift, or\n",
    "the proximity to other objects capable of deflecting or intercepting incoming particles. With present\n",
    "computing facilities, an interesting alternative would be to use detailed three-dimensional kinetic\n",
    "Chalaturnyk and Marchand Regression Interpretation of Langmuir Probes\n",
    "simulations capable of accounting for all the relevant physical\n",
    "processes under realistic geometry conditions. Kinetic\n",
    "simulations have been, and continue to be, applied to specific\n",
    "case studies and elucidate selected processes [8–10] but, due to\n",
    "the considerable computational resources and run times that they\n",
    "require, they cannot be used in real-time interpretation of probe\n",
    "measurements. An approach is proposed here to process low\n",
    "level L1B data from probe measurements (current as a function\n",
    "of voltage) into higher level L2 data (density, temperature,\n",
    "floating potential, ...) from kinetic simulations. The method\n",
    "consists of constructing a data set of probe characteristics\n",
    "for a given satellite and probe geometry, corresponding to\n",
    "selected plasma parameters. Given a measured characteristic, the\n",
    "corresponding plasma parameters would then be inferred with\n",
    "an adequate multivariate regression from the set of precomputed\n",
    "solutions, or “solution library.” This can be thought of as a\n",
    "specialized interpolation of plasma parameters in the space\n",
    "of probe characteristics. For simplicity in this first feasibility\n",
    "study, all characteristics are calculated analytically in the Orbital\n",
    "Motion Limited (OML) approximation, with the assumption that\n",
    "the results obtained with these synthetic data will bear relevance\n",
    "to those that would be obtained using computer simulations.\n",
    "In the following we assess the feasibility of using multivariate\n",
    "regression to infer higher level plasma parameters from low level\n",
    "probe characteristics. The method used to construct a synthetic\n",
    "data base is explained, as well as two regression approaches based\n",

    "2. METHODOLOGY\n",
    "Two regression approaches are considered, both requiring\n",
    "training and validation data sets of varying size. As mentioned\n",
    "in the introduction, it would be prohibitively time consuming\n",
    "to construct such sets from computer simulations because of\n",
    "the large computing resources that would be required. Thus,\n",
    "for the purpose of evaluating the approaches, synthetic data\n",
    "sets are generated using the analytic OML approximation. This\n",

    "relax collocation at others in order to account for “nugget\n",

    "what follows we use a simplified formulation in which the\n",

    "account for nugget effects, are not included. The result is\n",
    "pure collocation at selected “pivots,” or points in parameter\n",

    "meshes generally yield less accurate models. However, model\n",
    "accuracy does not necessarily increase monotonically with the\n",
    "size of the mesh and, for the mesh sizes considered, the changes\n",

    "several numbers of pivots have been considered, with direct and\n",

    "With multidimensional domains in parameter space and large\n",
    "validation sets, however, the incremental optimization may be\n",

    "Figures 3, 4. In Figure 3, the dashed line shows what is expected\n",
    "for a perfect one-to-one correlation between model and data.\n",
    "In addition to relative errors, Figure 4 also shows the positions\n",

    "is based on a simplified version of kriging developed and\n",
    "used in geostatistics, and the other uses a neural network\n",
    "as developed for machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n",
    "The goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of using\n",
    "regression techniques to interpret probe characteristics in terms\n",
    "of physical parameters, given a data set, or solution library,\n",
    "consisting of probe characteristics and corresponding plasma\n",

    "positioned optimally in parameter space, so as to minimize the\n",
    "maximum relative error in a given validation data set. With\n",
    "neural networks, the pivot approach was not practical, and\n",
    "accurate models were only possible with sufficiently large (50–100\n",
    "entries) training data sets. All data sets were created randomly for\n",
    "neural networks, thus requiring further exploration to produce a\n",
    "more sophisticated selection method to test if smaller data sets\n",
    "(20 or less) will provide similar results to those of large sets.\n",
    "Such future work should include instance selection and fewshot learning techniques to improve the quality and relevance\n",
    "of training examples used in neural network models. Owing to\n",
    "the large computing resources and run times required, our results\n",
    "suggest that it should be practical to construct regression models\n",

    "small training data sets or equivalently, small numbers of pivots.\n",
    "A model based on a neural network, on the other hand, requires\n",
    "larger training sets in order to produce the same level of accuracy.\n",
    "Such an approach may be practical for data sets constructed from\n",
    "accurate and validated measurements provided that sufficiently\n",
    "large (> 20) data sets can be constructed. The analysis considered\n",
    "here focused on only two physical parameters n and T, with the\n",
    "assumption that plasma consisted of a single ion species (O\n",
    "+) and\n",
    "that voltages Vi with respect to background plasma were known.\n",
    "In general, electron and ion temperatures may differ, there may\n",
    "be several ion species with different masses and charges, and\n",
    "probe voltages are not known with respect to background plasma\n",
    "but rather with respect to the spacecraft ground. Thus, with Vfl\n",
    "being the spacecraft floating potential, and Vb,i being the probe\n",
    "bias voltages with respect to ground, it follows that\n",
    "Vi = Vfl + Vb,i\n",
    ", (10)\n",
    "which introduces Vfl as an unknown parameter. Many spacecraft\n",
    "have means of determining the floating potential [28–34]. With\n",
    "an independent measurement of Vfl it would be straightforward\n",
    "to extend the analysis considered here by accounting for the\n",
    "fact that a non-zero floating potential simply changes voltages\n",
    "by an additive constant. Another possibility would be to\n",
    "use the regression techniques to infer Vfl directly from the\n",
    "characteristics. The inclusion of this unknown, as well as others\n",
    "such as the ion temperature, mass and charge composition,\n",
    "should also be considered in a generalized regression problem,\n",
    "and those will be accounted for in future studies. In closing,\n",
    "we reiterate that simplifications have been made in this first\n",
    "assessment of the proposed methodology. In particular, synthetic\n",
    "data was used in lieu of kinetically computed characteristics,\n",
    "and noise was omitted for simplicity. Nonetheless, we conclude\n",
    "that regression with kriging, and possibly neural networks, is of\n",
    "interest for better interpreting particle sensor measurements and\n",
    "is worth pursuing.\n",
